The qemu2ChampSim tracer comes as is with no guarantee that it covers every conversion case.

The tool in cvtrace-tracer leverages the RISC-V instruction decoder in CHERI-QEMU to disassemble each instruction. 
It expects a trace from qemu in the binary cvtrace output format, NOT the default text trace.

To use the tracer, compile by running make. To convert a trace, use 

./qemu2ChampSim QEMU_TRACE CHAMPSIM_TRACE

Adding the -v flag will print each instruction written to the ChampSim trace file to stdout. This is mostly here for debugging purposes.
The -s flag requires the path to a sorted simpoints file and the interval size. This will output multiple ChampSim trace files and give
each one a unique name based on the starting instruction location.


Updates coming to the text-parser converter. This tool will only support riscv64-cheri traces.
cvtrace has some issues outputting correct capability metadata and doesn't correctly update the tags.
